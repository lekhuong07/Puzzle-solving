Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments. 
In C programming, a variadic function will contribute to the flexibility of 
the program that you are developing.

The declaration of a variadic function starts with the declaration of 
at least one named variable, and uses an ellipsis as the last parameter, e.g.

int printf(const char* format, ...);
In this problem, you will implement three variadic functions named , 
 and  to calculate sums, minima, maxima of a variable number of arguments.
The first argument passed to the variadic function is the count of the number of arguments, 
which is followed by the arguments themselves.

Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer .
Each test case tests the logic of your code by sending a test implementation of 3, 5 and 10 elements respectively.
You can test your code against sample/custom input.
The error log prints the parameters which are passed to the test implementation. 
It also prints the sum, minimum element and maximum element corresponding to your code.
