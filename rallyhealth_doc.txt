Write a program that accepts and integer N and sequence of digits, and fills in 0 or more operators (+,- and *, division is disallowed) to the sequence so that a mathematical expression is generated that totals N. For example, consider the input sequence 2100100. Operators can be inserted in a variety of ways that would evaluate to 2000. Examples:
2100 - 100
2*100*10 + 0
2*100*10 - 0
2*-100*-10 +- 0 is NOT allowed.
2*1000 + 0000 is also NOT allowed
Insert parentheses to modify operator predence is NOT allowed.
